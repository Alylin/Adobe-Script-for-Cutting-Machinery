# Adobe Script for Cutting Machinery

I created this script for my uncle who runs a sticker company to automate part of his workflow, specifically creating an SVG around a given image for his cutting machine.

This is, however, a small amount of unavoidable jank, which is not reflected in the final outcome, but means the code is running less than perfectly. This is due to a known issue with Adobe's scripting compatability, which has existed for years. 

Finally, this project leverages https://github.com/mark1bean/live-effect-functions-for-illustrator. Give it a look if you're doing scripting for Illustrator, can't recommend it enough.
